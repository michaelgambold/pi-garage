To run the app start a phone simulator (Android or iOS) and run

## Widgetbook

To simplify widget creation Widgetbooks has been configured so that individual widgets can be created independent of one another.

See the below commands to run widgetbooks

```bash
# Build widgetbooks
flutter pub run build_runner build

# Watch for changes so you don't have to manually rebuild all the time
flutter pub run build_runner watch

# Run chrome widgetbook UI. Note you have to push "r" as it doesn't auto refresh changes
bash flutter run -d chrome -t lib/widgetbook.dart
```

## Build app icons

The source file is `icon.ai`. A PNG is then created and put into `assets/icons/icon.png`.

You can then run the following commands to generate icons for both android and ios.

```
flutter pub get

```
